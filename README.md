# DazContentInstaller
Automates the process to install third-party content

## Requirements

Download 7z https://www.7-zip.org/  
I only tested the tool on that backend the others might work as well  
The tool only supports zip and rar archives at the moment

## Usage

You can either get the prebuild [Release](https://github.com/Ati1707/DazContentInstaller/releases)  
Or clone the repo and install the requirements to run it with python

**CREATE A SEPARATE LIBRARY FOLDER BECAUSE THIS TOOL IS NOT TESTED!!!!**

1. Change library path in the config file if it's not in the default location
2. Put the downloaded assets in the downloads folder(The assets must be archives)
3. Start the tool and wait. Depending on the archive size it can take a bit


After the content got imported you can delete the archives in the downloads folder
