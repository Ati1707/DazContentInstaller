# DazContentInstaller
WINDOWS ONLY!  
Automates the process to install third-party content  


7-Zip is included with the repo.  
No changes were made the standalone version got directly pulled from [https://www.7-zip.org/](https://www.7-zip.org)  

The tool only supports zip, rar, tar and 7z archives at the moment  
More can be added if needed but I only encountered these

## Usage

You can either get the prebuild [Release](https://github.com/Ati1707/DazContentInstaller/releases)  
Or clone the repo and install the requirements to run the main file with python

**USE A SEPARATE LIBRARY FOLDER BECAUSE THIS TOOL IS NOT STABLE YET!!!!**

1. Change library path in the config file. I only put a placeholder in it
2. Put the downloaded assets in the downloads folder(The assets must be archives)
3. Start the tool and wait. Depending on the archive size it can take a bit


After the content got imported you can delete the archives in the downloads folder if they got successfully imported
