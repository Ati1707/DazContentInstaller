# DazContentInstaller
Automates the process to install third-party content

## Requirements

Download 7z https://www.7-zip.org/  
I only tested the tool on that backend the others might work as well
The tool only support zip and rar archives I didn't encounter any other extension

## Usage

**CREATE A SEPARATE LIBRARY FOLDER BECAUSE THIS TOOL IS NOT TESTED!!!!**

1. Change library path in the config file if it's not in the default location
2. Put the downloaded assets in the downloads folder(The assets must be archives)
3. Start the tool and wait. Depending on the archive size it can take a bit


After the content got imported you can delete the archives in the downloads folder
