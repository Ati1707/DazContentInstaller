# DazContentInstaller
Automates the process to install third-party content

## Requirements

WINDOWS ONLY!

Download 7z https://www.7-zip.org/  
I only tested the tool on that backend the others might work as well  
The tool only supports zip, rar, tar and 7z archives at the moment  
More can be added if needed but I only encountered these

## Usage

You can either get the prebuild [Release](https://github.com/Ati1707/DazContentInstaller/releases)  
Or clone the repo and install the requirements to run the main file with python

**USE A SEPARATE LIBRARY FOLDER BECAUSE THIS TOOL IS NOT STABLE YET!!!!**

1. Change library path in the config file. I only put a placeholder in it
2. Put the downloaded assets in the downloads folder(The assets must be archives)
3. Start the tool and wait. Depending on the archive size it can take a bit


After the content got imported you can delete the archives in the downloads folder if they got successfully imported
